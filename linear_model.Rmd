Load key packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

set.seed(1)
```

Load the NYC airbnb data
```{r}
data(nyc_airbnb)
```

Look at the data/ do some cleaning

```{r}
nyc_airbnb =
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(
    stars = review_scores_location / 2,
  ) |> 
  rename(
    borough = neighbourhood_group
  ) |> 
  filter(borough != "Staten Island") |> 
  select(price, stars, borough, room_type, neighbourhood)
```

Do regression!
```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + borough, data = nyc_airbnb)
```

```{r}
nyc_airbnb |> 
  count(borough)

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(
    borough = fct_infreq(borough),
    room_type = fct_infreq(room_type)
  )
fit = lm(price ~ stars + borough, data = nyc_airbnb)
```

Look at `lm` stuff
```{r}
summary(fit)
```
